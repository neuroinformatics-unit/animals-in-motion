Specifically, add an entry like the following under the “View other versions” section:\n- [v2025.08](https://animals-in-motion.neuroinformatics.dev/v2025.08/): Version used for the inaugural workshop in August 2025\nYou also need to create a new tag with the format vYYYY.0M, and push it to the repository.

There’s also a special folder called dev/ that is deployed for pushes to the main branch.\nThe contents of the latest release are also copied to the latest/ folder, where the home page is redirected to.\nLinks to previous versions can be added to the book’s index.qmd file, under the “View other versions” section. Note that these links will only work on the deployed version of the book, not on the local version.\n\nA.4.1 Previewing the book in CI\nWe use artifact.ci to preview the book that is rendered as part of our CI workflow. This is useful to check that the book renders correctly before merging a PR.\nTo do so:\n\nGo to the “Checks” tab in the GitHub PR.\nClick on the “Build and Deploy Quarto Book” section on the left.\nIf the “Build Quarto book” action is successful, a summary section will appear under the block diagram with a link to preview the built documentation.\nClick on the link and wait for the files to be uploaded (it may take a while the first time). You may be asked to sign in to GitHub.\nOnce the upload is complete, look for book/_book/html/index.html under the “Detected Entrypoints” section.",
