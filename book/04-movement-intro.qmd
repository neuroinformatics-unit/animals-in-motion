# Analysing tracks with movement {#sec-movement-intro}

In this tutorial, we will first introduce the `movement` package
by walking through parts of its [documentation](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/).

After that you will be given a set of tasks to complete—using `movement` to analyse the pose tracks you've generated in @sec-sleap.

## What is `movement`?

In [chapters @sec-intro] and [-@sec-dl-cv] we saw how the study of animal behaviour has profited from the rise of deep learning-based markerless motion tracking tools.

In [@sec-sleap] we dove deeper into [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/), a popular package for pose estimation and tracking.
We saw how SLEAP and similar tools—like DeepLabCut and LightningPose—detect the positions of user-defined keypoints in video frames,
group the keypoints into poses, and connect their identities across time into sequential collections we call pose tracks.

The extraction of pose tracks is often just the beginning of the analysis.
Researchers use these tracks to investigate various aspects of animal behaviour, such as kinematics, spatial navigation, social interactions, etc.
Typically, these analyses involve custom, project-specific scripts that are hard to reuse across different projects and are rarely maintained after the project's conclusion.

In response to these challenges, we saw the need for a versatile and easy-to-use toolbox that is compatible with a range of ML-based motion tracking frameworks and supports interactive data exploration and analysis.
That's where `movement` comes in.
We started building in early 2023 to answer the question: __what can I do now with these tracks?__

::: {.callout-note title="movement's mission"}

`movement`aims to facilitate the study of animal behaviour 
by providing a consistent, modular interface for analysing motion tracks, 
enabling steps such as data cleaning, visualisation, and motion quantification.

See [movement's mission and scope statement](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/community/mission-scope.html) for more details.

## A unified interface for motion tracks

`movement` aims to support all popular animal tracking frameworks and file formats,
in 2D and 3D, tracking single or multiple animals of any species.

To achieve this level of versatility, we had to identify what's common across the outputs of motion tracking tools
and how we can represent them in a standardised way.

What we came up with takes the form of multi-dimensional arrays.
Let's go through the [documentation on movement datasets](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/user_guide/movement_dataset.html) for more details.
