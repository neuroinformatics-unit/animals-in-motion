# Prerequisites {#sec-prerequisites}

## Knowledge
We expect a basic familiarity with Python and ideally, with its core
scientific libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter.

## Hardware
This is a hands-on course, so please bring your own **laptop** and **charger**. 
A **mouse** is also strongly recommended to facilitate tasks like image annotation.
A dedicated **GPU is not required**, though it will speed up some of the computations.

## Software

### Coding environment

::: {.callout-note}
If you already have a working Anaconda/miniconda installation, and have used it to run Python scripts and/or Jupyter notebooks, you can probably skip the following steps.
:::

To make your computer ready for coding in Python, we recommend following the [Software Carpentries install instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions), and more specifically the following steps:

- [Bash Shell](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#shell), so you can run commands in your terminal.
- [Git](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#git), including a GitHub account.
- [Python](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#python), which will set you up with the [conda-forge installer](https://conda-forge.org/download/).


Additionally, you will need a code editor (an IDE) that is configured for Python use.
If you are already have one installed and configured, stick with it. Otherwise, we recommend one of the following:

  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
  - [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install)


### Specific software tools

You will need to install two software packages, [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/) and [movement](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/),
in separate conda environments.

For SLEAP, you can find the installation instructions here: <https://sleap.ai/installation.html>.

::: {.callout-note}
For this workshop, we will be using SLEAP version 1.3.3, so make sure to replace the latest version number (e.g. `1.4.1`) with `1.3.3` in the instructions.
:::

The installation instructions for `movement` are available here: <https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/user_guide/installation.html>.

::: {.callout-note}
Any version of `movement` greater than or equal to 0.8.1 will work for this workshop.
You will also need to use `movement`'s GUI, so make sure to follow the appropriate instructions for your operating system.
If you're looking for a one-line command, the following will probably work:

```bash
conda create -n movement-env -c conda-forge "movement>=0.8.1" napari pyqt
```
:::

## Data
Bringing your own data is encouraged but not required.
This could include video recordings of animal behaviour and/or motion tracks you've already generated.
If you don't have your own data, we will provide example datasets for you to work with.
